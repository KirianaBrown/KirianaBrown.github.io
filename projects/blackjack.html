          <img src="blackjack.png" alt="Image of Black Jack Game" id="blackjackImage"style="width:100%">
          <p> The key to the design was based on a clean/simple design with links to casino felt tables. The button colours were selected to draw attention of the player.
            Future improvements would be to make this more responsive and fit to screen height to prevent scroll, clean up the add player name section and relocate the score sheet. <p>
